				<h3>Refrigerator:</h3> <br>
				<h4>Defination:</h4>
				<p>A refrigerator is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump that transfers heat from its insight to its external environment so that it is inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature. <br>
					In 1913, American Fred W. wolf invented the 1st home electric refrigerator. Mass production of domestic refrigerators began in 1918  when William C. Durant introduced the 1st home refrigerator with a self-contained compressor. <br>
					A domestic refrigerator has two functions: <br>
					1.	PRIMARY- To provide food storage space maintained at low temperature (0 degrees Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius) for food preservation. <br>
					2.	SECONDARY- Formation of ice cubes. <br>
					A refrigerator works on vapour compression cycle (V.C.C).
					It is a compression process whose aim is to raise the refrigerant pressure as it flows from an evaporator. <br>
					R-134a is commonly used refrigerant in it. <br>
					Capacity of domestic refrigerator is expressed in terms of litres. Standard refrigerators of capacity 90,165,210,300,420 litres etc are available in market.

				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Compressor:</h5>The compressor is known as “Heart” of a refrigerator .It is a black dome shaped machine which is located in the basement of it .  Suction , discharge and charging tubes are fitted to the compressor. Control devices such as relay , overload protector etc are also fitted to it.
					It circulates the refrigerant throughout the system and adds pressure to the warm part of the circuit and makes refrigerant hot.
					</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Condensor:</h5>The condenser sets on the back of a refrigerator and is likely quite dusty. Inside ,  the refrigerant is cooled down and condenses (turns from gas to liquid).</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Evaporator:</h5>It is located inside a refrigerator and makes the items in the refrigerator cold  . As the refrigerant turns from liquid into gas through evaporation, it cools the area around it . Ice box in which ice trays are kept is also a part of evaporator for producing small quantity of ice.</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Capillary Tube:</h5>The capillary tube is the thin piece of tubing that serves as an expansion device The liquid refrigerant is rotated through capillary tube and spirit into the low pressure environment of the evaporator.</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Thermostat:</h5>It controls the cooling process by monitoring the temperature and then switching the compressor on( if too hot) and off (if too cold).</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Drier And Strainer:</h5>Strainer is provided to remove impurities from the refrigeration system.         Drier  is provided to remove the moisture from the refrigeration system..</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Rubber Gasket:</h5>A soft rubber gasket with magnetic wire is provided at the door of Cabinet to prevent the atmospheric air from entering into the refrigerator cabinet through small openings.</p>

				><h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Refrigerator Working:</h4>
				 <p>1.	Low pressure low temperature liquid refrigerant enters into the evaporator absorbs heat from the space to be cooled and gets converted into low pressure low temperature vapour  refrigerant it creates cooling effect in the space to be refrigerated. <br>
					2. This low pressure vapour refrigerant is sucked by the compressor where its pressure and temperature are increased by compression <br>
					3. High pressure and high temperature vapour refrigerant delivered by compressor is cooled and condensed to liquid state in the condenser . Thus, the Heat is rejected by the refrigerant in the condenser. <br>
					4. Then, this high pressure liquid refrigerant is passed through capillary tube where it undergoes throttling expansion and due to expansion its pressure reduces.
					Low pressure and low temperature liquid refrigerant is suppred to evaporator , where it absorbs heat from the space to be cooled. This completes one cycle. The above cycle is repeated again and again till the desired refrigerating effect is achieved. <br>

				><h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Applications:</h4>
				<p>1. In household to store and preserve food stuff and keep drinks cool in summer season. <br>
					2. An industry it helps in removing heat from large scale processes or materials by reducing the temperature to a standard value. <br>
					3. It helps in maintaining the quality the quality of glue and paint.<br>
				   </p>
				<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Advantages:</h4>
				 <p>1. Cooling- it keeps  a drink like juices, water etc cool at the time of summer when atmosphere is extremely hot. <br>
					2. Food preservation-  it helps to preserve food stuffs (cooked food or raw food) so that they maintain their natural physical appearance and nutritive value. <br>
					3. Human friendly- daily shopping is no longer necessary It saves steps ,energy and time. <br>
					</p>
					<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Disadvantages:</h4>
					<p>1. The texture and flavor of food can be affected by freezer burn. It is safe to eat freezer burnt foods but they are distasteful. <br>
						2. Vitamins B,C and antioxidants of fruits and vegetables get destroyed in refrigerator which protect us from cell damage. <br>
						3 Refrigerators are costly it requires high cost investment initially as well as in maintaining electricity to it.<br>
