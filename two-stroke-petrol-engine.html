				<h3>Two Stroke Petrol Engine:</h3> <br>
				<h4>Defination:</h4>
				<p>In thermodynamics a heat engine is defined as, a “system that converts heat, thermal and chemical energy to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work”.Engines are classified into various categories based on the type of the cycle they use , thelayout ,the energy source used, the cooling mechanism or its use. Based on the layout, thereare two types of Engines. <br>
				1. Internal Combustion Engines<br>
				2. External Combustion Engines
				<h4>Parts of Engine:</h4>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Piston:</h5>
				<p>The piston is moved up and down by a crankshaft, which is connected to it via theconnecting rod. When the piston reaches the top the spark plug then lights the airmixture burning it and sending the piston back down .It is free to move. It compressesthe   air   fuel   mixture   and   converts   the   fuel   energy   into   the   mechanical   energy.   Ittransmit the power to the crankshaft.</p>
				</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Crankshaft:</h5>
				<p>It is located in the bottom end of  the cylinder block. It transmits the reciprocatingmotion of the piston into rotary motion. This rotary motion used to rotate wheels ofthe vehicle.</p>
				</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Connecting Rod:</h5>
				<p>It connect piston to the crankshaft and transmit the motion of the piston to crankshaft.The lower end is connected to piston and the upper end to crankshaft.</p>
				</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Cylinder Head:</h5>
				<p>The top end of the cylinder is closed by means of a removable cylinder head. The inletvalve, exhaust valve, spark plug and injector are bolted on the cylinder head. Themain function of the cylinder head is to seal the cylinder block and not permit entryand exist of gases on the cover of head.</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Cylinder Block:</h5>
				<p>The main function of the cylinder is to guide the piston. It is in direct contact with theproducts of the combustion so it must be cooled. For cooling of cylinder a waterjacket or fin are situated at the outer side of the cylinder. So at the upper end of it cylinder head and at the bottom crankcase is bolted.</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Carburetor:</h5>
				<p>A device for mixing vaporized fuel with air to produce a combustible or explosivemixture, as for an internal combustion engine.</p>
				</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Spark Plug:</h5>
				<p>It is used in petrol engine. It is fitted on the cylinder head. It is used to ignite the airfuel mixture inside the cylinder at the end of each compression stroke.</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Piston Ring:</h5>
				<p>Piston rings provide a sliding seal between the outer edge of the piston and the inneredge of the cylinder. The rings serve two purposes: <br>1. They prevent the air mixture in the combustion chamber from leaking into the sumpduring   compression and combustion. <br>2. They keep all oil in the sump from leaking  into the area, where it would be burnedand lost.</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Spark Plug:</h5>
				<p>It is the parallel spindles fitted through the piston and connecting rod small end. Itconnects the piston to the connecting rod. In the internal combustion engines, thegudgeon pin connects the piston to the connecting rod and provides a bearing for theconnecting rod to pivot upon as the piston moves.</p>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Flywheel:</h5>
				<p>A flywheel is a rotating mechanical device that is used to store rotational energy. Theamount of energy stored in a flywheel is proportional to the square of its rotationalspeed. To keep the crankshaft. The flywheel is a disk that is about 30 to 40 cms indiameter.</p>

				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090;">Compressor:</h5>The compressor is known as “Heart” of a refrigerator .It is a black dome shaped machine which is located in the basement of it .  Suction , discharge and charging tubes are fitted to the compressor. Control devices such as relay , overload protector etc are also fitted to it.
					It circulates the refrigerant throughout the system and adds pressure to the warm part of the circuit and makes refrigerant hot.
					</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Condensor:</h5>The condenser sets on the back of a refrigerator and is likely quite dusty. Inside ,  the refrigerant is cooled down and condenses (turns from gas to liquid).</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Evaporator:</h5>It is located inside a refrigerator and makes the items in the refrigerator cold  . As the refrigerant turns from liquid into gas through evaporation, it cools the area around it . Ice box in which ice trays are kept is also a part of evaporator for producing small quantity of ice.</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Capillary Tube:</h5>The capillary tube is the thin piece of tubing that serves as an expansion device The liquid refrigerant is rotated through capillary tube and spirit into the low pressure environment of the evaporator.</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Thermostat:</h5>It controls the cooling process by monitoring the temperature and then switching the compressor on( if too hot) and off (if too cold).</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Drier And Strainer:</h5>Strainer is provided to remove impurities from the refrigeration system.         Drier  is provided to remove the moisture from the refrigeration system..</p>
				<p class="construction"><h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Rubber Gasket:</h5>A soft rubber gasket with magnetic wire is provided at the door of Cabinet to prevent the atmospheric air from entering into the refrigerator cabinet through small openings.</p>

				 <p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">In two strokes the suction and the exhaust strokes are eliminated. There are only tworemaining strokes these are the compression stroke and the power stroke and usuallycalled as upward stroke and downward stroke. Instead of valves the two stroke engine
					consists of inlet and exhaust ports. The fresh charge enters into the cylinder throughthe inlet ports and the burnt gases escape out through exhaust port. A Stroke is themovement of the piston from the top to the bottom of the cylinder. The two strokesare named as: <br>1. Upward Stroke. <br>2. Downward stroke. 
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Upward Stroke:</h5>
				<p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">During this stroke the piston moves and compresses the charge in the combustion chamber ofthe cylinder. Because of the upward movement of the piston a partial vacuum is created in thecrankcase and this allow the entry of the fresh charge into the crankcase through uncoveredinlet port. The exhaust port and the inlet port remain covered and the ignition of the freshcharge takes place through spark plug.</p>
				<img width="200px" height="700px" src="assets/images/4StrokeEngine_Ortho_3D.gif" alt="4StrokeEngine_Ortho_3D">
				<p> Animated scheme of a four stroke internal combustion engine, Otto principle: <br>
					1. Intake stroke - Air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. <br>
					2. Compression stroke - Fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. <br>
					3. Power stroke - Fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards. <br>
					4. Exhaust stroke - Exhaust is driven out.<p/>
				<h5 style="color: #ec6090 ;">Downward Stroke:</h5>
				<p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">As the combustion of fresh charge takes place a large amount of hot gases is produced whichexerts a high pressure force on the top of the piston.Due to the high pressure force the pistonmoves downward and rotates the crankshaft and does useful work.Further downwardmovement of the piston uncovers first the exhaust port and the transfer port and the exhauststart through the exhaust port. As the transfer port is open the charge through it is forced intothe cylinder.The charge strike the deflector on the piston crown rises to the top of thecylinder.The cylinder is completely filled with the fresh charge but diluted with the exhaustgases finally the cycle event is then repeated.</p>

				<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Advantages:</h4>
				 <p>1. Two stroke engine gives a working stroke for each revolution of crankshaft. The fourstroke engine gives a working stroke for each two revolutions of crankshaft.<br>
					2. Power developed by the two stroke engine is twice then the power developed by the fourstroke engine for the same engine speed and volume. <br>
					3. It has high mechanical efficiency. <br>
					4. It is simple in construction and mechanism. <br>
					5. There is no value mechanism in it.The ports can be easily designed, covered and uncovered by the movement of the piston itself.
					</p>
					<h4 style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Disadvantages:</h4>
					<p>1. It has high fuel consumption.<br>
						2. Thermal efficiency is less than the four stroke engine. <br>
						3. It produces greater noise.<br>
						4. There is a greater wear and tear of moving parts. <br>
						5. It does more consumption of the lubricating oil.
